          Since you've refused every time I ask, I guess this is the only way to
          express what I really feel. My apologies for making you feel bad. I'm
          just mad because I thought you didn't take it personally when I've
          been trying to invite you for lunch, or when I wanted to walk you
          through after work. Also, I've been scared, I admit. And I don't want
          to hurt you. You are the only one who has truly opened up my heart. I
          don't even seek love nor someone to rely on. I've been trying to focus
          on myself but I'm also afraid that this might be my greatest regret if
          I remain silent. Among all of the beautiful faces I've seen,
          <span class="highlight"
            >you're still the one I wanted to see every day</span
          >. You are more than enough, Olivia — and there's nothing else in this
          world I could've asked for. I guess you can feel how much I like you,
          and I mean it — but it's actually much deeper than that. I've never
          been so sure in my whole life, but the day you came, I knew what I
          really wanted: <span class="highlight">you</span>. Of all the people
          I've met, you're the only person I can't get off my mind. It drives me
          crazy every night thinking about you, knowing we don't even talk that
          much. I overthink about you a lot — especially when you're away. I
          miss you every single day. I know I'm bad at communicating, and I hate
          that about myself. The night I saw you with someone else, I was hurt.
          I tried to stop myself, but sometimes I can't deny it —
          <span class="highlight">I'm still into you</span>. I don't know. I
          just don't feel like being with someone else. <br /><br />
          I thought the black hole had the strongest pull in the universe, until
          I realized it was your eyes. You are the kind of person I want. I like
          you so much, and I hope we can have a cup of coffee sometime — if you
          want.

          <br /><br />
          <em
            >PS: I'm not expecting anything from you. All I need is to express
            how I actually feel and that's enough. No worries.

            It's getting hard for me to breathe. -->
